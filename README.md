# logisim-cpu

This repository contains a "Simple as Possible" ([SAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple-As-Possible_computer)) CPU
implemented with [Logisim](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) following Ben Eater's [excellent tutorial](https://eater.net/8bit)
on building an 8-bit computer from scratch on a breadboard.

This project was created alongside my son as a way to teach him computing fundamentals.

We try to keep the design as similar as possible to Ben Eater's breadboard version, including breaking out signals
into individual wires to keep the same look.  Eventually, we may try to build the breadboard version.

## Frozen

This project has been frozen and forked to [sap-cpus](https://github.com/ungood/sap-cpus), which will contain additional
implementation of SAP CPUs (ex: FPGA and PCB)
